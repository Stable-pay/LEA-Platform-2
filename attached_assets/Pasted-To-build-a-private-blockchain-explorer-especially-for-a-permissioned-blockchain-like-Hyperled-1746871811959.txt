To build a **private blockchain explorer** (especially for a permissioned blockchain like **Hyperledger Fabric**), you‚Äôll need a tailored stack that reflects your network's internal transactions, identities, and channel data‚Äî**without exposing confidential data**. Here‚Äôs a full breakdown to help you get started:

---

## üß≠ WHAT IS A PRIVATE BLOCK EXPLORER?

A **private block explorer** is a web-based UI that allows **authorized users** to:

* View transactions on a private ledger
* Track case anchoring, KYC hashes, STR events, and court submission proofs
* Monitor node activity and smart contract events

## üèóÔ∏è TECH STACK OVERVIEW

| Layer                     | Tools                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend                  | React + Tailwind + Chart.js / Recharts              |
| Backend                   | Node.js (Express)                                   |
| Ledger API                | Hyperledger Fabric SDK (Node/Go)                    |
| Database (Optional cache) | PostgreSQL or MongoDB                               |
| Auth                      | Role-based JWT or OAuth2                            |
| Infra                     | Docker + Fabric CA + CouchDB (for queryable states) |

## üß± CORE MODULES IN THE BLOCK EXPLORER

### 1. üîé **Block Viewer**

* Display block height, timestamp, block hash, and TX count
* Drill-down into individual transactions

### 2. üìú **Transaction Viewer**

* List recent transactions (case anchoring, STR submitted, etc.)
* Transaction ID, involved keys, payload (decoded), submitter identity

### 3. üîê **Identity Access**

* Show transaction endorsements and peer signatures
* Track which org signed which event (FIU, ED, Bank, etc.)

### 4. üß¨ **Smart Contract Events**

* Track chaincode invocations (e.g. `SubmitSTR`, `AnchorCase`)
* View inputs, results, emitted events (optional logs)

### 5. üì¶ **Channel Explorer**

* Per-channel views (e.g. `FIU-Bank-Channel`, `ED-I4C-Channel`)
* See all blocks and activity scoped to that channel

### 6. üßæ **Case Index Search**

* Map Case IDs ‚Üí TX Hashes
* Search cases by wallet, status, or user (with access controls)

---

## üîß HOW TO BUILD

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Set up Fabric SDK Backend

Use the [Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/) to:

* Connect to peers
* Query blocks by number or hash
* Decode transactions and endorsement signatures

```js
const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
const block = await network.getChannel().queryBlock(blockNumber);
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: REST API Layer

Create Express APIs like:

```
GET /api/blocks/latest
GET /api/blocks/:number
GET /api/transactions/:txId
GET /api/cases/:caseId
```

Cache responses in Redis/PostgreSQL for performance if needed.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Frontend UI (React)

* Table for blocks and TX
* Case/timeline view
* Charts: TX volume, org-wise activity
* Filters (by channel/org/smart contract)

Use:

* `React Query` for API state
* `Recharts` or `Chart.js` for graphs
* `Radix UI` for components

---

## üîí SECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROL

* All explorer views should be **behind login**
* Use roles (LEA, FIU, ED, VASP, Court) to control which channel's data is accessible
* Fabric supports **channel-level privacy** ‚Äî explorer should respect that

## üöÄ OPTIONAL ADD-ONS

| Feature                  | Description                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Arkham/Chainalysis Embed | For wallet lookup                           |
| Evidence Proof           | File hash ‚Üí block anchor lookup             |
| PDF / JSON export        | Per TX or per case                          |
| Fabric Events            | WebSocket stream for live updates           |
| Audit Logs               | Who viewed what (for judiciary/legal audit) |

## üì¶ REPO STARTERS

While there‚Äôs no official Fabric block explorer from the Hyperledger team, these repos can help:

* [`hlf-explorer`](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-explorer) by IBM (outdated but forkable)
* [`fabric-block-explorer`](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer) (official, but needs updates)
* [`fabric-viewer`](https://github.com/aidtechnology/fabric-viewer) ‚Äì A better modular base

Would you like:

* A working React + NodeJS explorer scaffold?
* Dockerized dev environment for local Fabric chain + explorer?

I can provide a GitHub repo or downloadable zip to get you started.
