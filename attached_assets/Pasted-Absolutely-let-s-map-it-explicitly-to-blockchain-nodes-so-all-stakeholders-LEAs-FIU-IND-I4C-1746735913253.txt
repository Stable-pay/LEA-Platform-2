Absolutely — let’s map it **explicitly to blockchain nodes** so all stakeholders (LEAs, FIU-IND, I4C, Banks, Exchanges, Courts) understand **where data resides**, **what is logged immutably**, and **how each action becomes a tamper-proof event** on the blockchain. Here's the **revised version** with **blockchain node annotations**:

This layout defines **which stakeholder runs a blockchain node**, **what data is logged on-chain**, and **how it benefits investigations and compliance**.
